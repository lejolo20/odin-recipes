    <h2>Description</h2>

    Cacio E Pepe is one of our all time FAVORITE pasta dishes. This lightened </br>
    up version calls for making your pasta from scratch—the good news is it's so </br>
    much easier than it sounds. All you need is a good nonstick pan. It's so simple </br>
    and yet so fun to make and, of course, absolutely delicious. Made it? Let us know </br>
    how it went in the comment section below!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
          <li>4 large eggs </li>
          <li>Kosher salt</li>
          <li> 2 tsp. canola oil </li>
          <li> 1 tbsp. butter</li>
          <li>1/4 c.freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for serving</li>
          <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Crack eggs into a medium bowl and season with salt. Whisk until smooth.</li>   
        <li>In a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 teaspoon oil. Add half the egg mixture and twirl the pan to evenly coat the bottom of skillet with egg. Cook, undisturbed, until edges are set, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Run a spatula along edges of egg to release, then use your hands to gently flip the omelette. Cook until egg is just set on the bottom, about 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Slide omelette onto a cutting board and let cool slightly for 1 minute. Meanwhile, repeat process with remaining oil and eggs. Roll omelettes up like a cigar and slice into ¼-inch thick "noodles."</li>
        <li>Return skillet to medium-high and melt butter. While whisking, slowly pour in ¼ cup water until combined. Add Parmesan and pepper, and stir until Parmesan melts into sauce. Add noodles and toss to coat. </li>
        <li>Season with more pepper and sprinkle with more Parmesan before serving.</li>

    </ol>
